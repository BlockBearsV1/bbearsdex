Trading Fee

BBearsVSwap charges a 0.3% trading fee on all transactions conducted on the platform. These fees contribute to the reward pool for LP providers and BBVS token holders. Consequently, higher trading volumes lead to more significant rewards for participants.

Admin and LP Provider Split

Out of the 0.3% trading fee, 33% is allocated to the platform's administration. The remaining 67% is distributed among LP providers as their share. This split ensures a fair distribution of rewards while encouraging LP providers to contribute to the liquidity pool.

LP Token Locking and Burning

Purpose of Locking LP Tokens

Locking a percentage of LP tokens for three years helps stabilize the liquidity of the ecosystem. It prevents severe fluctuations in LP token availability, ensuring a healthy trading environment. Besides, the locked LP tokens act as a long-term commitment to the project's sustainability.

Purpose of Burning LP Tokens

Burning a portion of LP tokens reduces the total supply, thereby increasing the scarcity and value of the remaining tokens. This process enhances the overall liquidity of the token and can lead to potential price appreciation. By reducing the supply, the project aims to reward long-term holders and build a more sustainable ecosystem.
